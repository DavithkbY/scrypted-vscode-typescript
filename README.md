# Sample Scrypted Plugin

1. npm install
2. Open this plugin director yin VS Code.
3. Edit `.vscode/settings.json` to point to the IP address of your Scrypted server. The default is 127.0.0.1, your local machine.
4. Press Launch to start debugging.
  * The terminal may show a failure and prompt you to log in with `npx scrypted login`. You'll only need to do this one. You can then relaunch afterwards.
